## Description

> This repository is for my personal growth in learning more SQL features in MySQL. My objective is to make GUI applications connected to a remote database that can be accessed by third parties. I intend for the functional dependencies to be in 3NF as well as scalable with big data. This is a work in progress still. I would like this to be themed around an online store that sells videogames and manages user information.

## Database Population

> Since I don't have GUI applications set up at this time, most of the data is pseudo-generated. These files can be found in the repository under generator.py as well as its usage. All pseudo-generated data is fake and non-exploitable.
